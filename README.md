# Connect-Kinesis-Consumer

This is a Kinesis consumer example of connecting a Java application to the Kinesis data feed.

This feed allows us to monitor changes that occur on a Dynamodb table

The table out on dev is called Test-Monitored-Table

Once you get the application running you can do and Add or Modify a record in that table and you will see the change get logged in your terminal in VSCode.
